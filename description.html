                When William Bedford Clark's book of poems <i>Blue Norther</i> was published
                by the Texas Review Press in 2010, a reader noted that his verse ranges
                "in subject matter and setting from the profane to the sacred." Often
                reflecting the history and culture of the South and Southwest, Clark's
                poetry employs "a variety of forms and voices" and meditates upon
                "the mysteries of the past, personal and collective," even as it
                surveys "the possibilities and liabilities of the present." In each
                poem, Clark "strives to approximate music, in keeping with the
                author's insistence that dancer and dance be one."

                That description might well apply to the contents of this site. The
                items presented here constitute all the poetry Clark completed following
                the appearance of <i>Blue Norther</i>, including the contents (in different
                format and order) of the chapbook <i>Ways and Means</i> (Caminada Bay Press,
                2016), printed in a limited edition and now difficult to come by. The 17
                poems from <i>Ways and Means</i> are followed by five later pieces, four of
                which appear here for the first time.

                Clark is a neo-formalist poet and a traditionalist by temperament and
                conviction. He explores a variety of forms and meters, including the
                sonnet, ballad, dramatic monologue, blank verse, modified free verse,
                acrostics, and alexandrines. There is a satiric edge to many of the
                poems, the foibles of academe a special target. Some reflect a
                distinctly Catholic sensibility; others deal with erotic matters frankly
                and without flinching. Subjects range from hagiography to the John
                Wilkes Booth legend, from the suicide of a friend and colleague to folk
                narratives preserved in oral tradition. Humor, both good-natured and
                dark, is a common element. In these poems, laughter carries with it a
                serious purpose.
