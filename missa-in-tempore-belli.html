                By noon the Mall awaits,<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;though sad Isaiah warned<br />

            <p><i>the war we wanted disappoints<i><p>

Gas prices stalled last week,

so squat new SUVs

ascend the crumbling clover-leafs . . .

*the war we wanted disappoints*

Let record markets quake

and cell-phones skip a bleat,

still Chinese shoes adorn our feet . . .

*the war we wanted disappoints*

Prime steaks on high-tech grills

incense suburban air;

both parties promise real health-care . . .

*the war we wanted disappoints*

As Persians strain at nukes,

wronged Kurds now lay for Turks,

and Chavez slips Big Oil the works . . .

*the war we wanted disappoints*

Take Google as your guide:

you'll find old friends, odd facts,

and disembodied carnal acts . . .

*the war we wanted disappoints*

With cable for our vine

and credit our fig tree,

we're free to be what we shall be . . .

**miserere nobis**
